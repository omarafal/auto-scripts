# Bash Scripts

This repository contains a bunch of bash scripts I created specifically for myself to automate certain tasks that I repeat on a regular basis.

## Scripts List

### sess
Stands for "Session". Takes one argument, the number of the session. Creates a folder with the name "Session {number}" and in it creates two files:
- index.html
- script.js

It then opens the folder in Visual Studio Code. 

This script is made to automate the previous steps that I do at the start of every college training session.
